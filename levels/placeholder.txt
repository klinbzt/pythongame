# Levels

In this directory we will have the layouts created with Tiled, which we will then import and load. As far as I could tell, the files resemble HTML, but there needs to be done some more research.

Basically, each planet has its own directory. In it, the layouts of each level, which we load when the player gets ready to enter a new level of the planet. We also have a planet_config.json file, which we'll use to store the relevant data on each planet, such as the gravity of the planet, the background of the levels of this planet ( from assets ), the background-music ( from assets ), etc
