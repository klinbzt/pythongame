# Physics

Here we implement everything related to physics

Note: I was thinking that we split this into multiple classes, and each object inherits the specific class it needs:
-> E.g: class PlayerPhysics will inherit class Player created in entities/player.py. We can then use the methods provided by the PlayerPhysics class with the parameters provided by the Player class ( or something like that )

-> Same for terrain, objects, etc

-> Gravity can be a class that everyone inherits, since everything in our game is affected by gravity ( except maybe terrain )
