# ui

1. hud.py

Here we write the functions that display the stats of the player on the screen ( health, deaths, powerups he has, etc. ) and other stats ( current planet, current level, etc. )

2. menu.py

We might need a menu for the player to navigate to a previous level, or restart the level if he messes smth up, etc. ( we need to discuss this over )
